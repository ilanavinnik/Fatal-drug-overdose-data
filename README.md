• Time series trends from 2020 to 2024
• Demographic breakdowns by age, sex, race, and ethnicity
• Interactive maps showing geographic distribution
• Dynamic slicers for drug type, metric (deaths, rates, percentages), and year
Tools and techniques
• Microsoft Power BI
• Data modeling and DAX measures
• Interactive visuals including maps, line charts, bar charts, and KPIs
Purpose
This project is intended for public health analysis, data visualization practice, and portfolio demonstration. It highlights how interactive dashboards can be used to communicate complex public health data clearly and effectively to both technical and non-technical audiences.
